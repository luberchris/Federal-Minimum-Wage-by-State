### Project Purpose
To demonstrate the percentage of each US state's population earning wages at or below the Federal Minimum Wage per year between the years 2015 and 2021.

### Data Review
This data comes as a group of fact tables broken out according to state. Each table represents a year's worth of data, with three columns in each. The first column, state, represents the primary key for each is the name of the state written out (ex. Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, etc.). The next column, total, is the sum of the next two columns. The next column, at\_minimum\_wage, represents the percentage of the state whose population earns the federal minimum wage as a decimal number (ex. 3.4 = 3.4% as opposed to 0.034). The final column, below\_minimum\_wage, is represented in the same fashion as the previous column, and represents the percentage of each state whose population earns below the federal minimum wage.

This data is captured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and can be augmented by further datasets that highlight industry, gender, education, etc.

### Insights

* The US Federal Minimum Wage has remained stagnant at $7.25 per hour since 2010. This dataset highlights the fact that, while both prices and wages have been rising across the country in general, 2.21% of American workers still receive less than or equal to the Federal Minimum Wage.
* The state with the greatest drop in percentage of workers below the minimum wage since 2015 has been Arizona, while the least significant is Delaware.
* Louisiana and DC are the top two areas with the highest percentage of their population earning at or below the Federal Minimum Wage.
